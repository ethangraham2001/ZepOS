# ZepOS

My Minecraft username when I was 11-years-old was `zep3657`, so I decided to 
name my toy OS after it.

We'll see where this goes. OS dev is hard.

The structure is taken from Sortie's [meaty skeleton template](https://wiki.osdev.org/Meaty_Skeleton),
and I'm basing most of what I do off of the OSDev wiki material.
